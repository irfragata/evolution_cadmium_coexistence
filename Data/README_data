There are two files in the data folder, corresponding to the two assays performed for the manuscript entitled "Evolution in response to an abiotic stress shapes species coexistence".

File: CompetitiveAbility Cd_G40_submit.csv

Raw data pertaining to the assays used to estimate the intrinsic growth rate and intra and interspecific competitive ability.

Identification for each column

Block - Random number attributed according to the day when the experiment was installed. Data from the same block was installed and manipulated in the same day.
Rep - Number coding for the experimental evolution replicate for each selection regime. Each selection regime had 5 experimental replicates.
Box - Number of the petri dish box that groups several leaf disks
Leaf - Number of the leaf type used for creating the disk. For the experiment 2 types of leaves were used, leaves 3 or 4, that correspond to the third and fourth leaf counting from the root.
Disk - Number of the disk position in the petri dish box (1 to 16)
Env - Codes for the Environment were females were tested. Has two levels: N (no cadmium) and Cd (cadmium).
FocalSR - Selection regime of the focal female. There are four levels: 1, 2, 4 and 5
CompSR - Selection regime of the competitor female. There are four levels: 1, 2, 4 and 5
Dens - Number of females installed in the disk
Type - Column that codes what type of competition that was tested: intra and interspecific
Focalfemale - Species of the focal female (Tu - T. urticae, Te - T. evansi)
FocalDead - Number of dead focal females at the time of the killing of the installed females
FocalDrowned -  Number of drowned (in the water) focal females at the time of the killing of the installed females
FocalMissing -  Number of missing focal females at the time of the killing of the installed females
NumbDeadComp -  Number of dead competitor females at the time of the killing of the installed females
TeFemales - Number of adult T. evansi females generated by the installed females
TuFemales - Number of adult T. urticae females generated by the installed females
Observations - Observations related with extra informatio for the boxes, or disks.
 
File: Coexistence Cd_G42_submit.csv

Raw data pertaining to the population growth rate assays.

Identification for each column

Rep - Number coding for the experimental evolution replicate for each selection regime. Each selection regime had 5 experimental replicates.
Block - Random number attributed according to the day when the experiment was installed. Data from the same block was installed and manipulated in the same day.
1st_pair -  Number of the leaves first added to each box. Two groups of leaves were used: pairs 2-4, 3-5. These pairs were created to equalize the resources available to the spider mites.
2nd_pair - Number of the leaves added after one generation of the start of the experiment. Two groups of leaves were used: pairs 2-4, 3-5. These pairs were created to equalize the resources available to the spider mites.
Env - Codes for the Environment were females were tested. Has two levels: N (no cadmium) and Cd (cadmium).
Box - Number of the small practiline box, represents the experimental unit
SRTu - Selection regime of the T. urticae species. There are two levels: Tu1, Tu2
SRTe - Selection regime of the T. evansi species. There are two levels: Te4, Te5
Leaflet - Number of the leaflet of the plant that was scored.
Leaf_2_Up_Tu,Leaf_2_Up_Te, Leaf_2_Down_Tu, Leaf_2_Down_Te, Leaf_3_Up_Tu, Leaf_3_Up_Te, Leaf_3_Down_Tu, Leaf_3_Down_Te, Leaf_4_Up_Tu, Leaf_4_Up_Te, Leaf_4_Down_Tu, Leaf_4_Down_Te, Leaf_5_Up_Tu, Leaf_5_Up_Te, Leaf_5_Down_Tu, Leaf_5_Down_Te - Number of females of each species (Tu - T. urticae, Te - T. evansi) that was scored on the upper (Up) or down (Down) side of the lead, for leaves 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Observations - Observations related with extra information for the boxes

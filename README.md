# evolution_cadmium_coexistence
This repository is a companion to the paper "Evolution in response to an abiotic stress shapes species coexistence" 

The scripts available allow with the data set provided to replicate all the analyses done in the paper, as well as the figures.

The Data folder contains the raw data
The Script folder contains the scripts to perform the analyses
The Analyses folder contains intermediate outputs required for the analyses.
The Plots folder contains the figures used in the manuscript (output from the code)

Given that running the cxr package requires sometime, we provided the intermediate files used to generate the figure, but we also provide the code done to generate the files, to ensure the total reproducibility analyses.
